# The Local Lane

Welcome to the Handcrafts Marketplace web application repository! This project is designed to provide a platform where users can easily discover and purchase local handcrafts and handmade products. The application allows users to sign up as either a regular User or as a Vendor, enabling Vendors to upload their product listings, including images, prices, names, and descriptions. This README file will guide you through the setup and usage of the application.

## Features

- **User and Vendor Roles**: Users can sign up as regular users or vendors.
- **Product Listings**: Vendors can upload product listings with images, prices, names, and descriptions.
- **Browse and Purchase**: Users can log in, browse products, and make purchases.
- **React Frontend**: The frontend of the application is built using React.
- **Node.js Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and TypeScript.
- **Database**: The application uses a database to store user information and product listings.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication is implemented for both roles.
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateways for handling transactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (or any other preferred database)
- Payment gateway account (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handcrafts-marketplace.git
   cd handcrafts-marketplace
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend directory
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SECRET=your_payment_gateway_secret_here
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your_database_url_here`, `your_jwt_secret_here`, and `your_payment_gateway_secret_here` with your actual database URL, JWT secret, and payment gateway secret.

4. Initialize the database:

   Run the necessary scripts to create and seed the database with initial data.

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd backend

   # Run database migrations
   npm run migrate

   # Seed the database with initial data (optional)
   npm run seed
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   # Start the frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm start

   # Start the backend
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```

6. The application should now be running locally. Access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up for an account or log in if they already have one. Vendors can also register and log in.

2. **Vendor Product Upload**: Vendors can upload product listings, including images, prices, names, and descriptions.

3. **Browse and Purchase**: Users can browse the available products, view details, and make purchases.

4. **Checkout and Payment**: Users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout. Payment integration with your selected payment gateway will handle transactions.

5. **Order History**: Users can view their order history and order details.

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation can be found in the `docs` directory of the backend code. You can access it by navigating to `backend/docs/index.html` after starting the backend server.
